 * en_reset_encoders() - initialize encoder values and position

 *	en_reset_encoder() reset the encoders at the start of a machining cycle.
 *	This sets the encoder_position to match the MODEL position. This establishes 
 *	the "step grid" relative to the current machine position. Note that 
 *	encoder_position is in integer steps, so it's not an exact representation 
 *	of machine position except if the machine is at zero. 
 *
 *	Reset is called on cycle start which can have the following cases:
 *
 *	  -	New cycle from G0. Position and target from Gcode model (MODEL). (canonical_machine, cm_straight_traverse()
 *	  -	New cycle from G1. Position and target from Gcode model (MODEL). (canonical_machine, cm_straight_feed()
 *	  -	New cycle from G2/G3. Position &target from Gcode model (MODEL). (plan_arc.c,  cm_arc_feed()
 *
 *	The above is also true of cycle starts called from within homing, probing, jogging or other canned cycles.
 *
 *	  - Cycle (re)start from feedhold. Position and target from runtime exec (RUNTIME);
 *		(canonical_machine.c, cm_request_cycle_start() )		
 *
 *	  - mp_exec_move() can also perform a cycle start, but wouldn't this always be 
 *		started by the calling G0/G1/G2/G3? Test this (planner.c, ln 175)
